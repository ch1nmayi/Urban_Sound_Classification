# Urban Sound Classification
 This repository contains a project for classifying 10 different urban sounds using the UrbanSound8K dataset. The repository includes a trained model, a model training notebook, and a Streamlit application for interactive sound classification.

# UrbanSound8K Dataset
The UrbanSound8K dataset is used for this project. It includes 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes:

1. Air Conditioner
2. Car Horn
3. Children Playing
4. Dog Bark
5. Drilling
6. Engine Idling
7. Gun Shot
8. Jackhammer
9. Siren
10. Street Music

# Model Training
The model was trained using the UrbanSound8K dataset. You can find the training process in the model_training.ipynb notebook . This notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

# Streamlit Application
The Streamlit application allows you to classify new sound clips using the trained model. To run the application, navigate to the streamlit_app/ directory and execute:
